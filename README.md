# GPTNT

_Can two AI agents talk each other through defusing a bomb?_

GPTNT is a benchmark for real-time collaboration between multimodal agents. Two AI agents play the
roles of _Defuser_ and _Expert_ in
[_Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes_ (KTANE)](https://keeptalkinggame.com). The Defuser sees the bomb,
the Expert reads the manual, and they must communicate to defuse it.
